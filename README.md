This is a new programming language, maybe not, but it's still very good. The function of this language is to nest the grammatical functions of other languages. For example, for example:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
This is a c language HelloWorld:
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
And this is a java HelloWorld, so what do you do to get them to run together?
