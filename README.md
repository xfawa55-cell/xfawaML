# xfawaPL
This is a new programming language, maybe not, but it's still very good. The function of this language is to nest the grammatical functions of other languages, for example:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}

This is a c language HelloWorld:

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

And this is a java HelloWorld, so what do you do to get them to run together?
This is a good question. The magic of this language is that it can put java and c code in the same file and run it together
# Other languages supported/Run command
Other languages currently supported are: Python shell lua C C++ go Ruby php Java JavaScript
A lot, at least in my opinion, the running command is like this
***python xfawa.py Your file name.xf***
Copy this command to the command line and it will run xfawaPL the code for
